# Godot_game
First Godot game to see how Godot works with 3D models 

You can play this game by downloading the JumpMan.rar file and then extracting it.
Clicking on JumpMan.exe will run the game. ( Make sure that JumpMan.pck is in the same directory as the JumpMan.exe executable )

Also, the executable's name will be Catacombs at the top left corner while it is running. Since I was going to make a catacombs fps battle royale. But that project proved to be too difficult for my first Godot game.

All of the gdscript code is open for everyone to read and use.
